# USA-Rain-Prediction

This project aims to analyze rainfall patterns across the USA and develop machine learning models to predict rainfall accurately. Using a dataset of 73,100 meteorological observations, key insights were derived regarding factors influencing rainfall. Exploratory data analysis revealed seasonal and regional variations, while predictive models such as logistic regression and decision trees achieved a notable prediction accuracy of 85%. Recommendations include enhancing weather monitoring systems and integrating predictions into planning frameworks. Tableau and Python visualizations were compared to ensure robust insights. Key findings:
- Seasonal and regional variations in rainfall.
- Humidity, precipitation, and cloud cover were the most significant predictors.
- Ensemble models achieved high accuracy but showed signs of overfitting.

Rainfall prediction is critical for planning in agriculture, disaster management, and water resource allocation. This project explores rainfall trends in the USA using historical weather data and evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in forecasting rainfall. Key questions addressed include:
+ How does rainfall vary by location and season?
+ Which weather factors influence rainfall the most?
+ How accurately can rainfall be predicted using available data?
+ How machine learning model accurately predict the likelihood of rain the following day?
